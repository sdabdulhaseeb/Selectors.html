        <mark><b>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</b></mark> is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[7] The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.[8]

<u>Symptoms of COVIDâ€‘19 are variable,</u><del>but often include fever</del>,<sup>[9]</sup> cough, headache,<sup>[10]</sup> fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste.<sup>[11][12][13]</sup> <em>Symptoms may begin one to fourteen days after exposure </em> the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms.[14] Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[15] Older people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[16] Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[16]
